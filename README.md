# How to use
1. Include `adjustSize.css` in your HTML.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="adjustSize.css">
```
2. Include `adjustSize.js` in your HTML.
```html
<script src="adjustSize.js"></script>
```
3. Create an element like this and assign an ID: 

```html
<div class="circle" id="yourID">
  <span>
      I am perfectly wrapped in the circle!
  </span>
</div>
```
4. Make a call to `adjustSize('yourID')` and pass the id in. Done!
```html
<script>
    adjustSize('yourID');
</script>
```

You can also change step 3 and 4 to a single step:
Make a circle using `makeCircle` and pass content in
```js
const circle = makeCircle("I am perfectly wrapped in the circle!");
```
And then append to where ever you want
```js
document.body.appendChild(circle);
```

You can also see the [example using adjustSize](exampleAdjustSize.html) or the [example makeCircle](exampleMakeCircle.html).
